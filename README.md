# Cyber security portfolio

As a recent graduate in Computing and IT (SOFTWARE) from the Open University and currently enrolled in the Google Cyber Security Certificate program, I bring a solid foundation in various technical domains, including programming languages such as Python, SQL, API's and Java. Hands-on experiences in creating small programs, websites, and games which can be seen in my GitHub profile in detail,  further demonstrate my practical skills in software development.

Driven by a genuine passion for technology and a commitment to contributing to a safer digital environment, I am eager to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity through the Google Cyber Security Certificate course and then continue further to also obtain the CompTIA Security+ certification. My goal is to leverage my programming skills to bolster organizations' security measures and protect against cyber threats.

With strengths in time management, fast learning,  attention to detail, and a strong passion for programming, I am confident I could excel in the cybersecurity domain. My dedication to continuous learning ensures that I am always ready to adapt and grow in this dynamic field.

**This portfolio is in its early stages and I will keep updating it and adding to it as I progress with my learning. **
