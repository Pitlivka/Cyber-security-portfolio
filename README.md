# Cyber security portfolio

I am a highly motivated and fast learner with a deep passion for technology and an unwavering dedication to continuous learning and development. Graduating with a first-class Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Computing and IT (SOFTWARE) from the Open University, I have cultivated a robust foundation in various technical domains, including ITIL, Agile software development, SQL, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and the use of APIs.

My academic journey included hands-on experiences, where I've created small programs, websites, databases, and games such as Wordle and Blackjack, using Python and SQL. These projects not only demonstrate my technical prowess but also illustrate my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. You can see my work in detail in my GitHub repositories, where I've openly shared my code and projects.

Driven by an earnest desire to contribute to a safer digital environment for all, I am currently enrolled in the Google Cyber Security Certificate program, with plans to further advance my expertise in the field beyond this certification. Cybersecurity appeals to me on multiple levels â€“ not only does it offer the opportunity to apply my programming skills and knowledge, but it also aligns with my values of respecting laws and regulations and ensuring adherence to established rules and protocols.

The changing landscape of cybersecurity fascinates me, and I'm dedicated to using my programming skills, particularly in Python and SQL, to make a meaningful impact in this field. With a strong foundation in computing and a commitment to delivering excellence, I'm excited about transitioning into a cybersecurity role where I can actively contribute to strengthening organizations' security measures and protecting against cyber threats.

My strengths in time management, attention to detail, and passion for programming further enhance my readiness to excel in the cybersecurity domain, where precision and adherence to protocols are crucial.
