# Cyber security portfolio


I am a highly motivated and fast learner with a deep passion for technology and an unwavering dedication to continuous learning and development. Graduating with a first-class Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Computing and IT (SOFTWARE) from the Open University, I have cultivated a robust foundation in various technical domains, including ITIL, Agile software development, SQL, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.

My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experiences, where I've crafted small programs, websites, databases, and games such as Wordle and Blackjack, using Python and SQL. These projects not only demonstrate my technical prowess but also illustrate my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. You can delve deeper into my work via my GitHub repository, where I've openly shared my code and projects.

Driven by an earnest desire to contribute to a safer digital environment for all, I am currently immersed in the Google Cyber Security Certificate program, with plans to further advance my expertise in the field beyond this certification. Cybersecurity appeals to me on multiple levels â€“ not only does it offer the opportunity to apply my programming skills and knowledge, but it also aligns with my values of respecting laws and regulations, and ensuring adherence to established rules and protocols.

The evolving landscape of cybersecurity captivates me, and I am committed to leveraging my programming acumen, particularly in Python and SQL, to meaningfully contribute to this field. With a solid grounding in computing, coupled with a fervent commitment to excellence, I am eager to transition into a cybersecurity role where I can actively contribute to fortifying organizations' security postures and safeguarding against cyber threats.

My strengths in time management, attention to detail, and passion for programming further bolster my readiness to excel in the cybersecurity domain, where precision and adherence to protocols are paramount.
