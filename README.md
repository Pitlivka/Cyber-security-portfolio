As a recent graduate in Computing and IT (SOFTWARE) from the Open University and currently enrolled in the Google Cyber Security Certificate program, I bring a solid foundation in various technical domains, including programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Java. Hands-on experiences in creating small programs, websites, and games further demonstrate my practical skills in software development.

Driven by a genuine passion for technology and a commitment to contributing to a safer digital environment, I am eager to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity through the Google Cyber Security Certificate program. My goal is to leverage my programming skills to bolster organizations' security measures and protect against cyber threats.

With strengths in time management, attention to detail, and a fervent passion for programming, I am well-prepared to excel in the cybersecurity domain. My dedication to continuous learning ensures that I am always ready to adapt and grow in this dynamic field.
